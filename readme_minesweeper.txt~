How to run the program: 
    Run Minesweeper.java with no arguments (java Minesweeper). This
    will run the minesweeper game with 9 rows and columns and 10 
    randomly placed mines
    
Additional features: 
    I implemented a flagging feature, which can be used to mark 
    unrevealed blocks. Blocks are both flagged and unflagged by 
    pressing the "f" key.
    
File Descriptions:
    
    Block.java:
        Creates instances of the Block object, which are the building
        blocks of the minesweeper game. Each block contains fields that
        determine what image they will display in PennDraw, as well as 
        their size, depending on the number of cells in the grid.
